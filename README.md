# GroupProject-LifeUnderTheSea-Android
This is a group project which is developed during my third year of bachelor's degree of computer science in Universiti Sains Malaysia. It is a simple eduaction mobile application that integrated with image recoginition capabilities using CNN model.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The main objective of this system is to improve kidsâ€™ general knowledge about the marine creatures. The core feature of our system is that we apply deep learning technology in recognizing the images. So, the user will know the name of the animals after uploading or taking a picture. Fun facts about the animals will also be displayed to the users. Besides, kids can improve their problem-solving skills by answering quizzes in the application. Users will get some XP values when they unlock new species or after they have attempted the quizzes. This is to record their learning progress in order to motivate them to discover more species through our application.
